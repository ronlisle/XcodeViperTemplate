The Viper unit test case files provide a starting point for your tests.
They provide tests verifying the linkage between the files, but do not
test any functionality. You will need to add tests to do that.

Tests case files created:
   ___FILEBASENAME___InteractorTests
   ___FILEBASENAME___PresenterTests
   ___FILEBASENAME___WireframeTests

Mock objects created:
   Mock___FILEBASENAME___Interactor
   Mock___FILEBASENAME___Presenter
   Mock___FILEBASENAME___Wireframe
